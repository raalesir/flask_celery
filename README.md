Flask + Celery Send Mail Hello World
====================================

The repo is the result of the attempts to run the code from the [Miguel's blog article](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/using-celery-with-flask).
That beautiful article is about 4 years old, so just to copy-paste and run did not work.
Sadly, the repo does not accept pull requests as well, so the code is here.

The repo provides up to date code to run the Example1 i.e. to send email asynchronously with Celery.
